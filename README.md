Dear Professor Wang,

Nice to meet you! I appreciate that you read my letter during your busy time.

My name is Qiuhui Li. I am an undergraduate student major in communication engineering at 
'Chongqing University' , China and I will get my Bachelor degree in July 2018.
I read your paper “SGated Bi-directional CNN for Object Detection”, 
which is fascinating and appealing to me, because machine learning 
especially the deep learning is an intriguing area that I want to devoted myself to. 
I sincerely hope to become your PH.D in the future.


#Rich research experience about machine learning and building models
I am proficient in Python and have experience in data visualization.

In Junior year, as a public funded exchange student at the National Central University. 
I connected with a professor and entered his laboratory. Since then, I have already studied the knowledge about machine learning for nearly a year and a half and mastered 


* I master some neural network like CNN, RNN and MultiTask Learning and some traditional neural 
networks like Levenberg-Marquardt and used matplotlib to realize data visualization. 
The professor even told his masters learned from me in our group meeting due to 
my excellent performances. 

* I participated in publishing a papers about machine learning at the International Conference 
this year, using CNN and Levenberg-Marquardt to realize the data forecast. 
In this process, the most precious asset was the coverage and persistence of overcoming the 
problems rather than the outcome.
* Now, I have passed two rounds of selection to enter the National University of 
Singapore Research Institution to study, and my Final Year Project 
is applying Machine Learning into publishing.

I believe that my learning of Artificial Intelligence in these two years will lay a 
solid foundation for me to enter your laboratory to research and study further, 
and my efforts and new ideas could be quite helpful to what the research topic demands.

#Strong learning ability and Sheer tenacity
* During the exchange of learning, I challenged myself to select two master courses 
Teachers did not suggest me to do due to the difficulties. I was not afraid instead 
studied harder and got 98 and 96 eventually, which outstripped the majority of masters.  

* Now, my total GPA is 3.65/4 and I rank 3/119. I never give up and always press 
ahead despite difficulties. My GPA was 3.77 in my freshman year, winning the first 
place in the whole grade. However, my GPA was only 3.0 in the first term of sophomore, 
for I focused on contests in that period. I felt upset and remorse, which push me forward. 
Through efforts, my GPA went up to 3.74 in the second term of sophomore and 3.98, 3.91 
in two terms of junior year respectively. And I am absorbed in mathematical problems, 
I got 90 and 94 in in Mathematical Analysis of Engineering Class in two terms respectively 
and got 100 in Complex Variable Function & Integral Transformation.

* I joined to publish two papers at the International Conference, completed two 
invention patents and was awarded as Top Ten Youth Student Award by Chongqing 
University, which was regarded as highest honor in my school.
 
Should you require any more information, I would be glad to provide. My academic transcript and Curriculum Vitae is attached along with for your kind perusal.

Thanking you for your kind consideration and looking forward to receive your favorable response.

Best regards!

Qiuhui Li
